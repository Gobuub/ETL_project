def comunio_stats(team_lst, journey):
    '''
    Description.
    ------------
    
    With this function we want to obtain a dataset from diferents sources with the stadistics of all players of
    La Liga, to value its performance across the season.
    
    Params.
    -------
    
    The function receives a list with the teams of La Liga, and a the  journey's match.
    The team from teams_lst is a list with some variables:
        
        - index[0] : Name of the team from the var team_lst
        - index[1] : Team id from the var team_id
        - index[2] : url of comuniate that give us almost of the data 
                    (Player name, Position, Season Points, Season Points Average, Value, On start average)
        - index[3] : url of comuniazo that give us the points of the last 5 matchs of the each player on the squad
        - index[4] : url of espn that give us the matchs played, goals received (goalkeepers), goals, assists.
    
    Journey's Macht only works from actually journey to future journeys (we can't obtains data from past journeys with this script)
    
    Returns.
    --------
        Prints the name of the team with each iteration.
        When script finish , returns 'Finished'
        Store in 'data' directory this files:
        
            1 csv file with teams of La Liga, 'data/teams.csv'.
            1 csv file with the player's squad for each team, 'data/team_name_J_number_of_journey.csv'.
            1 csv file with all the player's stats of La Liga.
            1 json file with all the player's stats of La Liga.
